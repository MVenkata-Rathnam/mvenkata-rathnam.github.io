Muralidharan"],description:"The stanford car classification problem is solved in two stages using resnet-101.  The inital model pre-trained on Imagenet already knows to classify the given image as a car. Each car manufacturer keeps some unique features in the car which will be present in all the models released by that manufacturer. So, the pre-trained model is first fine-tuned to classify the car into different manufacturers alone. This will help the model in learning the common features that manufacturer keeps in every model. Now, this fine-tuned model is further trained to perform the actual classification of the cars into the corresponding models. In the second stage, the model just has to find the features which makes a car model distinct from the other models of the same manufacturer.

Fine tuning a model which is already trained on a larger set in the same domain (i.e. image classification) gives an upperhand in solving the problem rather than training a model from scratch.  The pretrained model that has been choosen here is Resnet-101 as this model has the least top-5 error on Imagenet 1-crop dataset. The advantage of Resnet (introduced by Microsoft) is that the model has a deeper architecture than a wider one. The number of parameters to be trained in Resnet is comparatively smaller than its variants due to its shortcut connections. This helps in training the model faster than the others.  Further, the dataset is highly unbalanced, to overcome this, data augmentation techniques like randomized cropping, flipping, and gamma correction and the other measures taken include weighted criterion, learning rate scheduling, and decaying weights.",links:{Kaggle:"https://www.kaggle.com/venkatarathnam/hackathon-blossom-spaic-mufasa"}},{title:"Dog Breed Classification",duration:"13 Jul 2019 to 15 Jul 2019",tags:["deep learning","classification","pytorch","python","resnet"],contributors:["Venkata Rathnam Muralidharan"],description:"The dataset consists of around 120 breeds of dogs.

The general information of the patient collected as PHR is stored in a separate cloud server, and the medical reports are stored separately in yet another cloud server. A second-step security control is provided using CAPTCHA which is mainly used as a security check to ensure that only human users can log in to the MediTrust. A third-step security control is also provided in which one key is shared to user’s registered mobile number and another key is shared to user’s e-mail id. In MediTrust, combination of these two keys is required to decrypt the PHR.
